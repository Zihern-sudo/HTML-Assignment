    <p class="p1"><cite class="fistLetter">TAR's </cite>Shoes Store. It was founded in 2000 as sports shoes and casual shoes by 
      <a  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Mouse" target="_blank"  style="text-decoration:none">
        <span style="color:rgb(121, 109, 109);font-size: 20px;">Jerry Li Ngan Jing Zhe</span></a>
    , who was a coach at the University Tunku Abdul Rahman College teaching basketball,
    and his former colleague Lee Zi Hern who was a former student studying in business. 
    In 1998, they started the store and established their first shoe store. 
    Due to the store's lack of exposure with the public, the business has been experiencing some 
    financial difficulties since it launched. Fortunately, as the time goes, TAR gained notoriety in Asia 
    and has been known as selling the greatest and most suitable shoes for our wonderful customers and advising 
    them on the kind of shoes and brands that are ideal for them. For our customers, we have always offered 
    the top brands of shoes, such as Nike, Adidas, and Puma. Apart from that, the main reason we sell limited-edition 
    or hard-to-find shoes is to give shoe lovers the opportunity to buy shoes since some of them might 
    not be able to do so due to the difficulty in finding these shoes, and also because our shoes is more reasonably priced 
    than that of other stores, this allows as many people as possible to buy while not worrying about their financial situation. 
    In conclusion, the goal of starting this company was to provide our customers an opportunity to purchase shoes from us.
